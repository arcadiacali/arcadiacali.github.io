          Hi, I'm Arcadia! I started traveling at two months old to visit family in Ireland. Eighteen countries, four
          continents, and fourteen states later, somewhere between airport gates and UNESCO World Heritage sites, I fell
          in love with culture: how people cook, celebrate, commute, and care for one another.
