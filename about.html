          Hi, I'm Arcadia! Traveling has been part of my life since before I could walk (literally). My first trip was
          to Ireland at two months old, and since then its been my mission to travel to as many places as possible. My
          life goal is to someday make it to all 195 UN recognized countries.

        <h2>How It All Began</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up in a family that valued stories from around the world—music, food, and the tiny customs that make
          every place unique. As I got older, I started keeping travel journals filled with notes on markets, festivals,
          and conversations with strangers who became friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Travel, to me, isn't just about seeing landmarks. It's about learning how people live, love, and celebrate.
          It's about finding home wherever you land.
